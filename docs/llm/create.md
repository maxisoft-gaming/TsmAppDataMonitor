let's create a c# app with net core 8.

For context:
TSM uses the TSM_AppHelper addon's AppData.lua file to inject auction data into WoW.

Path Accuracy:
World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\TradeSkillMaster_AppHelper\AppData.lua is the correct location for retail WoW. Replace _retail_ with _classic_ for Classic versions.

Addon Manager Interference: Correctly highlights that managers (CurseForge/WowUp) may overwrite AppData.lua. Solution: Exclude TSM addons from auto-updates.


, i'm targetting this file.
the goal is to monitor a file changes.
the path is given on the command line (os environ var) or read from a state file on cwd.

---

to monitor file changes use a notify like (watchdog in python) (try to use net standard one), in add to this method add a second/failback to a monitoring loop that check file size, file mod time. (think like notify method may fails anytime (including on start/monitoring/... and be sure to rely on the loop on that case)
then if there's change do not process asap wait for like 30 sec (configurable via command line) and if there's no new changes then process the file.
so if the notifier spam, delay the processing

File processing:
double check the file is not empty, read it with a lock (prevent other to write to it), hash it then if the hash doesn't match the previous file (hash saved in memory or loaded from a json files that save program state), write a new file.
the new file is saved to cwd by default but it may be configured via cmd line or env.
to save the file use compression (one that's incl in net framwork) with a fast compression.
name the file with the mod time (but humanize it like YYYY_MM***).

for the code, use robust code, the process need to be keept alive even if there's error, double check periodically that the target file is monitored by notify or the loop.
try to stick to standard net framwork libraries. you may use latest c# feature availble in net 8.0.
write good short maintenable code.
most of the configuration is done either by cmd line, env var. the file path may be also infered by a json state file if no other configuration is here.
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a C# .NET Core 8 application that monitors the TSM_AppHelper's AppData.lua file for changes. The main requirements are monitoring the file using both a filesystem watcher and a polling loop as a fallback, processing the file after a 30-second quiet period, handling compression, and ensuring robustness.

First, I need to figure out how to monitor the file. The .NET Framework has FileSystemWatcher, which can be used for the notify method. But the user mentioned that this might fail, so a backup polling mechanism that checks file size and modification time is necessary. The watcher could miss events, so combining both methods makes sense.

Next, handling the delay when changes are detected. The app should wait for 30 seconds (configurable) after the last change before processing. This requires a debounce mechanism. Using a timer that resets every time a change is detected would work. So, whenever a change is noticed, restart the timer to wait for the quiet period.

For file processing: Need to read the file with a lock to prevent others from writing. Using FileStream with FileShare.Read should allow reading while preventing others from writing. Then compute a hash (like SHA256) and compare it with the previous hash stored in memory or a state JSON file. If different, proceed to compress the file.

Compression in .NET can be done with System.IO.Compression, using Brotli or GZip. The user mentioned fast compression, so maybe Brotli with a fast compression level. The output filename should include a humanized modification time, like YYYY_MM_DD_HHmmss.

Configuration is via command line, environment variables, or a state file. The priority might be command line args first, then environment variables, then state file. For parsing command line arguments, maybe use a library like CommandLineParser or keep it simple with manual parsing. Since the user wants standard libraries, perhaps manually parse args.

The state file (like appstate.json) in the current working directory can store the last hash, file path, etc. Need to handle reading and writing this state, ensuring it's updated after each successful processing.

Error handling is crucial. The app should keep running even if there's an error processing a file. So, try-catch blocks around the processing code, logging errors, and continuing the monitoring.

Now, structuring the code. The main components would be:

1. Configuration manager: Handles reading command line, env vars, state file.

2. File monitor: Combines FileSystemWatcher and polling loop.

3. Debounce timer: Manages the delay before processing.

4. File processor: Reads, hashes, compresses the file.

5. State manager: Saves and loads the state (hash, path) to JSON.

Let's outline the steps:

- Parse command line arguments and environment variables to get the file path, output directory, quiet period, etc.

- If the path isn't provided, check the state file in CWD.

- Set up FileSystemWatcher on the target file's directory, filtering for the specific file.

- Start a polling loop (using a Timer) that checks the file's last write time and size every X seconds (maybe 5 seconds as a default).

- When either the watcher or polling detects a change, reset the debounce timer.

- After the quiet period elapses without further changes, process the file.

- Processing involves checking if the file is not empty, reading it with a lock, hashing, comparing to previous hash.

- If the hash is different, compress the file and save it with the timestamped name.

- Update the state file with the new hash and any configuration changes.

Potential issues to handle:

- The file might be locked by another process when trying to read. Need to handle IO exceptions and retry.

- The FileSystemWatcher might not work correctly if the file is on a network drive or if permissions are an issue. Hence, the polling fallback is essential.

- The app should periodically check if the watcher is still active. If the watcher's directory is deleted or becomes inaccessible, the polling should take over.

- Handling path changes: If the monitored file path changes via state or command line, the watcher and polling need to update.

For the compression, using BrotliStream with CompressionLevel.Fastest seems appropriate. The output filename could be something like AppData_2023_10_05_143022.brotli.

Testing the code with scenarios where the file is frequently updated (like by the addon manager) to ensure the debounce works. Also, simulating watcher failures to see if polling picks up the changes.

Now, writing the code. Start with the configuration class, then the state manager, file processor, and the monitoring classes. Use dependency injection where possible for testability, but since it's a console app, keep it straightforward.

Logging is important for debugging. Using Console.WriteLine or a simple logger to output messages about changes, errors, etc.

Make sure all parts are robust with try-catch blocks, and the main loop continues running even after exceptions.

Finally, ensuring that the app runs continuously, perhaps with a ManualResetEvent to keep the main thread alive until exited via Ctrl+C or another signal.

```

Key features:
1. Dual monitoring: Uses FileSystemWatcher + polling fallback
2. Debounce mechanism with Timer
3. File locking during processing
4. Brotli compression (fastest mode)
5. State persistence in JSON file
6. Error handling and recovery
7. Configuration via command line/env vars/state file

To use:
- Build with .NET 8 SDK
- Run as: `TSMMonitor.exe <path-to-AppData.lua>`
- Set environment variables:
    - TSM_OUTPUT_DIR: Output directory
    - TSM_MONITOR_PATH: File path override
    - TSM_QUIET_PERIOD: Quiet period in seconds

The application will:
1. Continuously monitor the target file
2. Wait for 30 seconds of inactivity after changes
3. Process and compress the file when stable
4. Maintain state between runs
5. Survive file access errors and continue monitoring

For production use, consider adding:
- Proper command line parsing (System.CommandLine)
- Logging framework
- Graceful shutdown handling
- More detailed error recovery
- Unit tests
